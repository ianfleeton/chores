# Chores

A simple app to help the kids get their chores done with less nagging.

## Learning

I'm planning to use Turbo, Stimulus, minitest, and Tailwind CSS to make this app. These are all a bit new to me so the code may not be as idiomatic as it should.

## Getting set up

The app is configured with MySQL as the database. It's just a personal preference so you can either install MySQL or switch to sqlite3 in `config/database.yml`.

Run the following in your terminal to perform some initial setup:

```zsh
bin/setup
```

And to get developing run:

```zsh
bin/dev
```

## Testing

Run:

```zsh
bin/rake
```
